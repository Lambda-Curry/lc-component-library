# How to deploy to Github.io

Checkout the `docs` branch. Merge in the latest code you would like to deploy. Run `yarn build:storybook` and push up the build to the `docs` branch. Github will automatically deploy static build to https://lambda-curry.github.io/lc-component-library.

# How this project was put together

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And converted into a component library based off of this article: https://hackernoon.com/creating-a-library-of-react-components-using-create-react-app-without-ejecting-d182df690c6b

Tailwind support was added with the help of this article: https://daveceddia.com/tailwind-create-react-app/
